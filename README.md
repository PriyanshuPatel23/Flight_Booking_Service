## DB Design
 - Booking


 - A Booking contains flightId, userId, noOfSeats so for that we've to connect to the Flight Serveice to get Flight data and calculate logic for remaining seats and also for the price


## Tables

### Booking -> id, flightId, userId, status, noOfSeats, totalCost, created_at, updated_at

- noOfSeats, totalCost added with migrations file after the creation of model


### Code to generate models
```
npx sequelize model:generate --name Booking --attributes flightId:integer, userId:integer, status:enum
```
### Code to generate Seeders file
```
npx sequelize seed:generate --name add-booking
```
```
npx sequelize db:seed:all
```
